## 🧠 Abstract

Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems use uniform processing, causing inefficiency as simple queries consume resources similar to complex multi-hop tasks. We present SymRAG, a framework that introduces adaptive query routing via real-time complexity and load assessment to select symbolic, neural, or hybrid pathways. SymRAG’s neuro-symbolic approach adjusts computational pathways based on both query characteristics and system load, enabling efficient resource allocation across diverse query types. By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6–100.0% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6–6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985–3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169–1151%, showing its significance for complex models. These results suggest adaptive computation strategies are more sustainable and scalable for hybrid AI systems that use dynamic routing and neuro-symbolic frameworks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbhakim/symrag.git
cd symrag
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., conda or venv)
# conda create --name symrag python=3.9 # Example for Python 3.9 [cite: 6010]
# conda activate symrag
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure spaCy models are downloaded
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_md # If used by QueryExpander or other components
```



### Environment Setup

List any environment variables your system needs:  
* `SYMRAG_MEMORY_TRACKING` (optional, for KnowledgeIntegrator)  
* Potentially API keys if you switch to API-based LLMs in the future.

Ensure your models (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B, mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 or v0.3, google/gemma-1.1-7b-it) are accessible or downloaded to your Hugging Face cache.

## 💡 SymRAG System Architecture

The SymRAG framework is architected as a multi-layered pipeline designed for adaptive computation and resource-efficient knowledge processing. It integrates symbolic and neural reasoners via a Hybrid Integrator, coordinated by a System Control Manager that optimizes for query complexity and system load.

![SymRAG Architecture](figs/symrag-arch.png)

### Key Components

**Query Processing:**
- **QueryExpander**: Analyzes query complexity (linguistic and structural properties) and potentially expands queries.
- **QueryLogger**: Logs query details.

**Adaptive Path Selection (SystemControlManager):**
- Dynamically routes queries to Symbolic, Neural, or Hybrid pathways based on query complexity $\kappa_{eff}(q)$ and system resource state $R(t)$.
- Utilizes dynamically adjusted thresholds $T_{sym}$, $T_{neural}$ for routing.

**Symbolic Reasoning Path (GraphSymbolicReasoner & GraphSymbolicReasonerDrop):**
- Employs knowledge graph-based approaches with predefined and dynamically extracted rules (e.g., 533 for DROP, 342 for HotpotQA).
- Provides structural guidance in hybrid processing.

**Neural Reasoning Path (NeuralRetriever):**
- Uses LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B, Mistral-7B) for dense retrieval and answer generation.
- Can be guided by RuleGuidedRetriever for context scoring and filtering.
- Supports few-shot prompting for tasks like DROP.

**Hybrid Integration (HybridIntegrator):**
- For HotpotQA (textual multi-hop): Employs embedding alignment (via AlignmentLayer) using multi-stage projection, cross-modal attention, and confidence-weighted integration.
- For DROP (discrete reasoning): Uses structured reconciliation for numbers, dates, and spans, including type agreement, confidence-based selection, and value reconciliation.

**Resource Management (ResourceManager, AdaptiveManager):**
- Continuously monitors CPU, GPU, Memory, and Power.
- Adapts system behavior (e.g., routing thresholds) based on system load.
